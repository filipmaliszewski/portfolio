        A visual campaign for @angeltooth, a small, independent tooth gem artist on Instagram. I’ve collaborated with her before, creating whimsical and kitschy visuals, including the now iconic “chicken with teeth” poster that resonated with Gen Z and brought a wave of new clients to her studio.
        <br><br>
        For this project, we had a quick conversation where she playfully referred to herself in the third person as “grandma.” That moment sparked the concept for a summery, tongue-in-cheek poster series centered around a “cool grandma” aesthetic. I began by collecting visual references, then generated a base image in SORA. From there, I refined and composed the final poster in Photoshop.

          Prompt: A photorealistic close-up portrait of a stereotypical old, a bit overweight grandma on a beach, shot with a fisheye lens. She has deeply wrinkled, leathery, slightly sunburned skin, and is leaning in toward the camera, pulling down her lower lip to proudly reveal sparkling tooth gems. Her expression is fierce and rebellious. She has messy grey hair. She has washed-out blackletter tattoos on her face and collarbones. The lighting is cool and bright like a high-fashion editorial shoot. The background is beach. The aesthetic is surreal skater-core meets Vogue fashion ad: iconic, kitsch, weirdly elegant, and subversively cool.
